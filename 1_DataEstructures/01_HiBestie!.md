# 🐍 01. Hi Bestie! - Python Data Structures Intro

## ✨ Introduction
Welcome back! It's Python time again — and we're leveling up. This chapter introduces **data structures**, the real MVPs of organized data handling in Python.

Whether you're making Nyan Cat GIFs 🌈 or building smart algorithms 🤖, Python’s libraries and data structures will help you do it efficiently and creatively.

## 🔁 Back to Basics: Data Types
Let’s review Python’s fundamental data types:

- 🔢 `int`: Whole numbers (e.g., `0`, `42`, `-5`)
- 🎈 `float`: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `0.0`, `12.99`)
- 🧵 `str`: Strings or sequences of characters in quotes (e.g., `'hello'`)
- ✅ `bool`: Boolean values (`True`, `False`)

## 🧺 What Are Data Structures?
Data structures are containers that help us organize and manage data. You’ve already used one before:

### Example of a List:
```python
social_platforms = ['TikTok', 'Instagram', 'BeReal']
```

Lists store ordered data and can contain various types. Super useful for managing collections!

## 🧱 Coming Up Next:
In this chapter, we’ll explore **three new** data structures:
- **Tuples**
- **Dictionaries**
- **Sets**

Each has its own strengths, and picking the right one can make your code more efficient and readable. 💪
